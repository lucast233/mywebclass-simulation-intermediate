Title of the Epic: Continuous Integration and Deployment

Description:
The Continuous Integration and Deployment epic focuses on automating the build, test, and deployment process of the website. This epic aims to streamline the development process, increase efficiency, and reduce the risk of errors and bugs.

Goals:

    Automate the build, test, and deployment process of the website
    Reduce the time and effort required to deploy new features and updates
    Ensure that the website is always in a deployable state
    Minimize the risk of errors and bugs

User Stories:

* [Developer](Stories/Developer.md)
* [Quality Assurance Expert](Stories/QAE.md)
    
Dependencies:

    Integration with version control system, such as Git
    Availability of a continuous integration and deployment system, such as Jenkins or Travis CI
    Access to server infrastructure to deploy the website

Risks:

    Failure to automate the build, test, and deployment process can lead to errors and bugs in the website, which can harm the user experience and the company's reputation.
    Manual deployment processes can be time-consuming and error-prone, which can delay the release of new features and updates.

Mitigation Strategies:

    Use a continuous integration and deployment system to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
    Use version control system, such as Git, to manage changes to the codebase and ensure version control.
    Use automated tests to catch errors and bugs early in the development process.

Estimated Effort:
The effort required to complete this epic will depend on the complexity of the website and the current development process. It may take 2-4 sprints to configure the continuous integration and deployment system, write automated tests, and automate the deployment process.

Business Value:
The Continuous Integration and Deployment epic can increase the efficiency and productivity of the development team, reduce the risk of errors and bugs, and improve the user experience. Automating the build, test, and deployment process can reduce the time and effort required to release new features and updates, which can lead to faster time-to-market and increased revenue.

Priority:
The priority of this epic should be high, as it is critical for streamlining the development process, reducing the risk of errors and bugs, and improving the user experience. It should be completed early in the project timeline to ensure that appropriate automation processes are integrated into the website's design and development. The user stories can be prioritized based on their impact on the development process and user experience.
