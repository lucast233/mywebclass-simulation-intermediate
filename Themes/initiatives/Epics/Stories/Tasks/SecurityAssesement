Task Title: Perform Security Assessment on User Registration Functionality

User Story: As a Security Expert, I want to perform a security assessment on the user registration functionality to identify any potential vulnerabilities and ensure that user data is protected.

Description: The Security Expert needs to perform a security assessment on the user registration functionality. The assessment should include a review of the registration process to identify any potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Acceptance criteria include:

    A review of the user registration process to ensure that it follows industry best practices for security, such as using secure passwords and two-factor authentication.
    A review of the input validation and sanitization to ensure that it prevents common attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
    A review of the server-side security controls, such as access controls and encryption, to ensure that user data is protected.
    A report that summarizes the findings of the security assessment and identifies any vulnerabilities that were discovered.
    A list of recommendations for mitigating the vulnerabilities and improving the security of the registration process.

The Security Expert should collaborate with the development and design teams to ensure that the security assessment does not impact the functionality or usability of the registration process. The Security Expert should also provide regular updates on the progress of the assessment and report any significant findings to the stakeholders.
