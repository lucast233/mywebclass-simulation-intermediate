Task Title: Test Checkout Process

User Story: As a tester, I want to verify that the checkout process is functioning correctly so that users can successfully complete their purchases.

Description: The tester needs to review the checkout process and verify that it is working correctly. The tester should test the entire process from adding items to the cart to completing the payment. Acceptance criteria include:

    Users can add items to the cart and update the quantity
    Users can view the cart and proceed to checkout
    Users can enter shipping and billing information
    Users can select a payment method and enter payment details
    The system correctly calculates the total cost, including any taxes and shipping fees
    The system displays a confirmation page after the purchase is completed
    Users receive a confirmation email with the order details

The tester should use different test cases to ensure that the checkout process works correctly in different scenarios, such as using different payment methods or shipping addresses. The tester should also verify that any error messages or warnings are displayed correctly and provide clear instructions to the user.
